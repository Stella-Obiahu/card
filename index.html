                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for 
                    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I entrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 
                    weeks was the best-and most growing-time of my life. Since completing the course. I've
                    successfully switched careers,working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                "The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which i find really refreshing. The
                program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself
                as a capable junior developer.The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
                attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. "

                "Before joining the bootcamp,I've have never written a line of code. I needed some
                structure from professionals who help me learn programming step by step. I was
                encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
                team project,in particular,was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level
                in a way no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I have gotten referred to it during interviews
                as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full
                stack-developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!. "
